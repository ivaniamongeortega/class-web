          Canned pumpkin purée and coconut milk, heavily seasoned with curry spices and lots
          of fresh lime juice, make a sweet-sharp sauce for chickpeas. It’s a rich, creamy
          curry that you can eat on its own, or serve over rice or couscous.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to incorporate more vegetables, stir in some <em>spinach</em>,
          <em>baby kale</em>, or <em>sliced green beans</em> during the last few minutes of
          cooking, letting them soften in the sauce.

        <h2>Preparation</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onion, jalapeño,
          and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden on the edges,
          about 8 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Add ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring
          frequently. Stir in garam masala, cumin, and turmeric; cook for an additional
          30 seconds.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in chickpeas, coconut milk, pumpkin, ½ cup water, and 1½ teaspoons salt.
          Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,
          to let the flavors meld. Add more water if the curry becomes too thick.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stir in cilantro and lime juice to taste. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Serve over rice or couscous if you like, and top with more cilantro and lime
          wedges on the side.
